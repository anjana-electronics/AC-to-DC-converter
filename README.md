 #AC to DC Converter PCB (KiCad)

 ##Project Overview
This project involves the design of an AC to DC Converter Printed Circuit Board (PCB) using KiCad.
The circuit converts AC input voltage into a regulated DC output suitable for powering electronic devices. 
The PCB layout is designed following standard PCB design rules to ensure safety, reliability, and proper functioning.

##Components Used
1.1N4007 Diodes(Bridge Rectifier)
2.Capacitor: 1000uF
3.Resistors
4.LED Indicator
5.Screw Terminals

##Software Used
 KiCad

 ##Description
 AC input is converted to DC using a bridge rectifier and filtered using a capacitor.
 This PCB is suitable for beginner-level power electronics learning

 ##Working Principle

1.AC Input
AC voltage is applied through a terminal block to the transformer.

2.Rectification
A bridge rectifier converts AC voltage into pulsating DC.

3.Filtering
A capacitor smooths the pulsating DC by reducing ripple voltage.

4.Regulation
The voltage regulator provides a constant DC output.
